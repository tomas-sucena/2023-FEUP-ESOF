### The Four Questions

#### What went well?
- We managed to work with Firebase authentication service without problems
- We got the interface close to the early mockups
- We made a correct use of every technology needed for this iteration
- We were able to produce clean and maintainable code
- We managed to review the code thoroughly

#### What didn't go well?
- We weren't able to finish all the planned issues for this iteration

#### What have we learned?
- How to plan an iteration
- How to set up a firebase project and use its authentication service
- How to work with many Flutter widgets, such as the BottomNavigationBar

#### What still puzzles us?
- How to manage expectations and plan an iteration accordingly
- Certain flutter details

### The Four Questions

#### What went well?
- We slightly tweaked the UI of our application, making it resemble even more our initial vision.
- We initialized our database in Firebase without any concerns.
- We continued writing maintainable and modular code, thanks in part to the design patterns we opted to follow (such as Observer).

#### What didn't go well?
- We overestimated how much time we would have for this iteration. <br>As such, an issue we had planned to tackle was not fully implemented.

#### What have we learned?
- How to design better UI in Flutter.
- How to switch themes in Flutter.

#### What still puzzles us?
- How to estimate and manage the time we have available.
- How to add/fetch data to/from the database.

### The Four Questions

#### What went well?
- We are now very accustomed to Flutter and, as such, we do not face nowhere near as many coding issues as we did in the beginning

#### What didn't go well?
- Once again, we estimated that we would have more time for this iteration. <br> Consequently, we could not close an issue we had planned to tackle.
- Even though we eventually figured it out, fetching data from the database proved to be more difficult than anticipated

#### What have we learned?
- How to manage our database (i.e. read/write data)
- How to write asynchronous code

#### What still puzzles us?
- How to properly manage time
- How to connect to an API
