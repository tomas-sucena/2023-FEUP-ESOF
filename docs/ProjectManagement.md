- We managed to review the code thoroughly

#### What didn't go well?
- We weren't able to finish all the planned issues for this iteration

#### What have we learned?
- We learned how to plan an iteration
- We learned to set up a firebase project and use its authentication service

### The Four Questions

#### What went well?
- We slightly tweaked the UI of our application, making it resemble even more our initial vision.
- We initialized our database in Firebase without any concerns.
- We continued writing maintainable and modular code, thanks in part to the design patterns we opted to follow (such as Observer).

#### What didn't go well?
- We overestimated how much time we would have for this iteration. <br>As such, both issues we had planned to tackle were not fully implemented.

#### What have we learned?
- We learned how to design better UI in Flutter.
- We learned how to switch themes in Flutter.

#### What still puzzles us?
- How to estimate and manage the time we have available.
- How to properly set up themes in Flutter (e.g. how to change the font color of each theme).
- How to add data to the database.
