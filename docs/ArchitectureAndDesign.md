## Architecture and Design
The architecture of a software system encompasses the set of key decisions about its overall organization.

A well written architecture document is brief but reduces the amount of time it takes new programmers to a project to understand the code to feel able to make modifications and enhancements.

To document the architecture requires describing the decomposition of the system in their parts (high-level components) and the key behaviors and collaborations between them.

In this section you should start by briefly describing the overall components of the project and their interrelations. You should also describe how you solved typical problems you may have encountered, pointing to well-known architectural and design patterns, if applicable.

### Logical architecture

#### Charity.net
* **Event Finder Application -** represents the graphical interface of the application (i.e. the various pages, the widgets, etc.)
* **User Authentication Logic -** responsible for the operations behind user authentication, such as linking each user to their Google account and ensuring the correctness of the login
* **Event Scheduling Logic -** all the operations that concern finding, publishing and filtering the volunteering events that appear on the user's timeline

#### External services
* **Event Database API -** service that retrieves the newest volunteering events that are posted on the Internet
* **Firebase -** database that stores the user authentication data

### Physical architecture
The goal of this subsection is to document the high-level physical structure of the software system (machines, connections, software components installed, and their dependencies) using UML deployment diagrams (Deployment View) or component diagrams (Implementation View), separate or integrated, showing the physical structure of the system.

It should describe also the technologies considered and justify the selections made. Examples of technologies relevant for uni4all are, for example, frameworks for mobile applications (such as Flutter).

Example of _UML deployment diagram_ showing a _deployment view_ of the Eletronic Ticketing System (please notice that, instead of software components, one should represent their physical/executable manifestations for deployment, called artifacts in UML; the diagram should be accompanied by a short description of each node and artifact):

### Vertical prototype
To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system.

In this subsection please describe which feature you have implemented, and how, together with a snapshot of the user interface, if applicable.

At this phase, instead of a complete user story, you can simply implement a feature that demonstrates thay you can use the technology, for example, show a screen with the app credits (name and authors).
